# Teeth-Type-Classification-App
This project fine-tunes an EfficientNetB0 model to classify RGB teeth images into 7 medical categories. The model is trained on a custom dataset with preprocessing, data augmentation, and evaluation through validation accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss/accuracy curves. A Streamlit app is included for easy image classification.
